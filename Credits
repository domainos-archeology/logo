Some of these I made myself, some were donated by others.  Unfortunately,
I've forgotten where most came from.  If you created one of these and want
to be added to this list, please let me know.


apollo is the original boot logo supplied by Apollo Computer.


"apollo_forever" is the boot logo I use.  I cooked it up one day last fall
when I was replacing the HP logo on a new node with the original from your
archive.  Thought I'd be a bit rebellious.
